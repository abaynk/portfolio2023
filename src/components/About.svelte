<h4 class="heading">ABOUT</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
  In 2018, I started pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at
  the Technical University of Vienna. However, after realizing that it is not
  something I want to connect my life with (both Mechanical Engineering and
  traditional education ü§™), I decided to embark on a path of self-education and
  learn Web Development skills. I now believe that constant practice and
  learning can help anyone become not only a good engineer but also a better
  individual.
  <br /><br />
  As of today, I have had the chance to work at a small startup, a medium-sized corporation,
  an out-staffing agency, and even as a freelancer on a well-known platform. I have
  explored various roles, including Frontend developer, JavaScript developer, and
  Software engineer. Throughout this process of finding the perfect role for myself,
  I have realized that my main passion lies in bringing amazing ideas and designs
  to life by building accessible, user-friendly, and engaging interfaces.
  <br /><br />
  Apart from coding, I love researching different topics such as self-improvement
  and religion. I have a goal to start creating content on YouTube this year to inspire
  people to dive into the world of coding and show them that it is possible to become
  a self-taught software engineer (or any other professional üòÅ)
